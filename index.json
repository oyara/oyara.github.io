The cloud is unlocking the power and freedom to achieve success, however you define it. As lifelong allies in business transformation, we know that one thing remains true: The Change Agents, who pursue this opportunity, will be challenged by complexity, resistance, and uncertainty. And now that technology-driven transformation is inevitable, We have an opportunity and a responsibility to acknowledge this challenge. On the journey to the cloud, Azure is both accompliance and shield. We are the Cloud Guide. A unique pairing of enterprise grit and innovation, in service of human achievement. And because trust is the currency of progress, we build inclusive, responsible, secure technology. Committed to the principles of community, we embrace open source with the free exchange of ideas and creativity. We rail against technology elitism and the inclusion borne of the cloud-only mindset. We believe that the success made possible by the cloud must be accessible to every business and every organization; small and large, old and new.
